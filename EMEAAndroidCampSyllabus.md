# Details #

## Course Goals ##
  * Get beginning university students with no previous Android development experience up to speed on mobile application development.
  * Provide the background necessary for students to have sufficient common ground to enter second-tier courses such as design, navigation and performance tuning, multimedia, user management, enterprise development and integrating additional APIs
  * Provide students with sufficient foundation to
  * Set up their development environment to create Android mobile applications with basic user interactions and activities
  * Create a dynamic and multi-pane user interface on Android by encapsulating UI components and activity states and behaviors into modules that they can swap into and out of their activities
  * Launch, interact, and receive results from different activities within the context of their application
  * Parse and persist data and populate data within their application
  * Manage backend performance for updates, notifications, and processing operations
  * Provide enough of a survey overview of main areas of Android for students to identify which follow-on courses they want to take.
  * Provide students with a foundation in Software Engineering application development approach in a collaborative environment

## Format ##
5 Days

Each day is
  * Android 101 ILT lecture units
  * Hack & Snack application collaboration time, with multiple experienced Android TAs to provide guidance and answer questions

Students will be divided into project collaboration teams. Each team will be responsible for completing the Hack & Snack assignments, ultimately producing an application prototype to demonstrate and explain at the Friday Eng Review.

The lecture portion of the course will NOT include guided application development, but will instead focus on high-level concepts. Students will be expected to leverage the developer.android.com website to suppliment the lecture materials, and apply the concepts learned to their own application development.
